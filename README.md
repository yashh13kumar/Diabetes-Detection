# Diabetes-Detection
I have made my machine learning project on diabetes detection. I am gathering a reliable dataset containing relevant information about diabetes patients. Through data preprocessing and feature engineering, I aim to prepare the data for training machine learning models. I will be exploring various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines to build a predictive model. 
The ultimate goal is to develop an accurate and reliable system for diabetes detection.
